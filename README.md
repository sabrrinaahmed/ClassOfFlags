# Class Of Flags
Thank you for viewing my program. I created this program in just 48 hours and it is my first time dealing with graphics so I am very proud of it. All the information below gives you a better understanding of what some of the files do.


Flags.cs --> Class of Flags that can be copied and applied to any program 

frmInput.cs --> End-user face for choosing a flag to view

frmOutput.cs --> End-user face for viewing the flag of choice

Program.cs --> Runs the frmInput.cs initially
